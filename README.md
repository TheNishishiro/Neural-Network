# About

A project to implement neural networks from scratch in C# 

# Introduction

For now the code is very messy as it's overcomming and overhaul from previous iteration, new code and architectrue can be found in *NNAPI* folder.

Everything outside that folder is either garbage or used to visualize progress of learning.

Current implementation only consists of dense MLP layers but the whole point of the overaul was to bring more different layers into play as well as add much more low-level customization so it's still very early into development. (considering I haven't worked on it since about 2 years).

For now I mostly tested it for binary classification and it reaches accuraccy of around 98% so similiar to the old code which if I remember correctly did a little better but at least it's new and mine.
I didn't test it on any more complex tasks and it probably wouldn't perform all that well either.
