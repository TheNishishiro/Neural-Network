# About

Simple program for classification of balls, yes... I made it back when trying to make a functional neural network.
Written in C# using MonoGame for visualizing the effect

To use neural network you pretty much only need NeuralNetworkv2.cs and NeuralNetworkLayer.cs since these are the implementation classes everything else is optional.

I didn't test it all that much but it seems whenever I use it it sort of works, so there is that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

# Features
* Multilayered customizable structure 
* 3 default activation functions altho relu works best
